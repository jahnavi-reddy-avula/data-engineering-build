# Data Engineering – Build in Public
This repository tracks my hands-on data engineering practice with a focus on production-style work.

## What I’m building
- SQL analytics and data modeling
- Python-based ETL and automation
- Cloud data pipelines and orchestration
- Data quality checks and documentation

## How I’m working
- Small, focused commits
- Emphasis on clarity, correctness, and explainability
- Realistic datasets and scenarios

## Repository structure
- `sql/` – analytical queries, window functions, modeling exercises
- `pipelines/` – ETL jobs, orchestration examples, and automation
- `projects/` – end-to-end mini projects
- `notes/` – short technical write-ups and learnings

## Goal
Build consistently, document learnings, and share progress weekly.
